# gazeboSimulation

File paths look for repo (gazeboSimulation) stored in a ros package named gazebosim.

Run while changing path as necessary:

echo "export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/dev/ros/catkin/src/gazebosim/gazeboSimulation/models:/usr/share/gazebo-7" >> ~/.bashrc && echo "export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=~/dev/ros/catkin/src/gazebosim/gazeboSimulation:/usr/share/gazebo-7" >> ~/.bashrc
